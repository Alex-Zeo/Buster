# Usage

To run the Buster prototype you need Python 3.11 or newer.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Configure your Discord bot token and other settings as environment variables.
3. Start the bot (this repository does not yet include the implementation).

The `docs/architecture.md` will provide additional information about how the
components fit together once completed.
